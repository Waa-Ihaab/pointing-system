This was my final project, which involved connecting an ESP8266 to a database using XAMPP servers. The most challenging part was during the design phase, but after weeks of hard work, it worked successfully.

Components used:
ESP8266
Fingerprint sensor AS600
3D printing a box to assemble the components"

Here are the component connections:
